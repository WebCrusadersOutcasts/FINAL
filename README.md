# FINAL
This is a combination of multiple tools to help police force in analysis of data and prediction for crimes, that are written in python language and in this instance we're running it in jupyter notebook. 

It's made up of 7 tools, each with their unique and specific functions. The codes can be viewed directly from the repo with the output as well. 

1. The first tool is focused on spatial analysis of the given dataset. In a selected district, it pinpoints the areas where crime occurred as well as the type of crime in one map by scatter points. And a heatmap displaying criminal activity based on density. It also shows the highest occurring crime in that district.
   
2. The second tool analyzes the beat data of a selected district and displays it in an easy to read format, as well as downloads it for the user in pdf form.
   
3. The third tool analyzes the date and time aspect of the dataset and organizes the data into different categories of graphs to make it easier to understand.
    
4. The Fourth tool is different from the first three as it analyzes the data given about the accused in crime cases. It organizes the given data and displays them. The tool uses them as features to calculate if the probability of the accused being a criminal is likely or not.
   
5. The fifth tool is slightly similar to the fourth one as it focuses on analysis of victims data info, and displays it. It also predicts the probability of a crime occurring in a selected district.
   
6. The sixth tool analyzes the beat wise data of a district and ranks them in order highest  crime rate to lowest crime rate.
    
7. The seventh tool is an AI model trained to predict locations where crimes are most likely to occur, as well as suggest a deployment plan that shows the nearest police stations and hospital in that area where the crime might occur.
   
All in all these tools will be integrated into a single website to make them easier to access.
